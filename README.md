**SwiftyEmail** is a mini library for iOS, iPadOS and Mac Catalyst using **MessageUI**. With SwiftyEmail, you'll be able to send e-mails from your app calling your user's **favorite e-mail app** (including third party ones!).

## âœ¨ Features

- **Send E-mails**: Easily send e-mails from your app by calling the correct e-mail app.
- **Third-Party Apps**: Send e-mails with Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Spark or Outlook. We've got you covered with Mail, also!
- **Simple**: Just call a single method and you're done. 
- **Built Swifty** and with **lightweight** in mind.
- **100% Swift**.
- **Documented**.

## ðŸš€ Get Started

### Using SwiftyEmail in Production Code
Just **import SwiftyEmail**:

```swift
import SwiftyEmail
```

Add the **LSApplicationQueriesSchemes** key to your **Info.plist**. It's an array with four strings.
```swift
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
	<string>googlegmail</string>
	<string>ms-outlook</string>
	<string>readdle-spark</string>
	<string>ymail</string>
</array>
```

It should look like this:

Okay! ðŸš€ Now, you can use it as you please. Use it like this:

```swift
SwiftyEmail.shared.sendEmail(subject: "Your order has been processed!",
                             body: "This is just an example for an e-mail body.",
                             recipient: "johndoe@gmail.com") { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let emailWasSent):
        print("The viewController was presented and the email \(emailWasSent)")
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error.localizedDescription)
    }
}
```

Then, the user's e-mail app is going to be called if the **result** is a success, with all the data provided.

Always remember that the e-mail has a **subject**, a **body** and a **recipient**, as well as the **result** for presenting the e-mail app.

## ðŸ”¨ Swift Package Manager
